Qualtrics Expanding Autocomplete

Eliciting lists of entries is something that comes up in my survey work fairly often. Presenting a long list of empty form fields is both ugly and intimidating. This custom question utilizes jQuery and Twitter's Typeahead to turn a Form type Text Entry question. Additionally, the text entries attempt to suggest entries loaded via Ajax. This functionality attempts to address the problem of open entry text by suggesting normalized data.
